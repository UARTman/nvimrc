# My configuration for neovim

I've finally done what I always kinda wanted to do, and wrote my own vim configuartion from scratch.

The configuration is written in lua, which means it will only work with neovim. It's not like there's any reason NOT to use it, right?

## Requirements

- neovim v0.7
- `fzf`
- `ripgrep`
- `lazygit`
- various language servers
